  <h2>Siargao</h2>
  <p>
    Siargao is known to be one of the famous places in the Philippines for surfing. Even though the island is very small, almost like a teardrop, it’s one of the most visited places. The entire island is bordered with white sandy beaches while the turquoise blue water washes off the shoreline. Inland waterfalls and lagoons are also present, which are major relaxing and rejuvenating spots.

    Samal Island is said to be one of the largest resort islands in the entire Philippines. It's one of those places where you won't ever get bored, thanks to the joyous lifestyle and the exquisite scenarios surrounding the island.

  <h2>Batan Island</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most interesting places to visit in the Philippines is Batan Island. It is a historical hotspot from WWII, and hence you can see several things like shipwrecks, ruined armouries, and others belonging to the Japanese. The island might be small, but the beach is quite wide, which is why you can spend a wonderful time sunbathing or simply walking on the white sand barefoot.
